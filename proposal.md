# The problem

> What problem do you want to solve? Why is it a problem? Who does it
> affect? What will solving the problem enable? This section should
> include a brief summary of existing work, such as R packages that may
> be relevant. If you are proposing a change to R itself, you must
> include a letter of support from a member of R core.

# The plan

> How are you going to solve the problem? Include the concrete actions
> you will take and an estimated timeline. What are likely failure modes
> and how will you recover from them? The Team: Who will work on the
> project. Briefly describe all participants, and the skills they will
> bring to the project.

# Project Milestones

> Outline the milestones for development and how much funding will be
> required for each stage ( as payments will be ties to project
> milestone completion ). Each milestone should specify the work to be
> done and the expected outcomes, providing enough detail for the ISC to
> understand the scope of the project work.

# How Can the ISC help

> Please describe how you think the ISC can help. If you are looking for
> a cash grant include a detailed itemised budget and spending plan. We
> expect that most of the budget will be allocated for people, but we
> will consider funding travel, equipment and services, such as cloud
> computing resources with good justification. If you are seeking to
> start an ISC working group, then please describe the goals of the
> group and provide the name of the individual who will be committed to
> leading and managing the group’s activities. Also describe how you
> think the ISC can we help promote your project.

# Dissemination

> How will you ensure that your work is available to the widest number
> of people? Please specify the open source or creative commons
> license(s) will you use, how you will host your code so that others
> can contribute, and how you will publicise your work. We encourage you
> to plan content to be shared quarterly on the R Consortium blog.
